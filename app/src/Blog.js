            "We're not in Kansas anymore", said a very confused Dorothy to an even more confused Toto. Same here 
            (but less confused). Just moved to Pittsburgh, and I am thrilled to start grad school at 
            Carnegie Mellon this fall! (no flying monkeys yet, but I'll let you know of any sightings.)
